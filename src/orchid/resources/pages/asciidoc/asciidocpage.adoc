== linking

|===
| sample relative linking | result

| <<linkeddoc#linkedSection, asciidoc linked via xref!>>
| inter document cross reference (first choice),
_could work with :outfilesuffix: to remove .html suffix_

| link:linkeddoc{outfilesuffix}#linkedSection[asciidoc linked via link!]
| link relative (second choice), _could work with :outfilesuffix:_

|===

== including

_including does not work with orchid. E.g. safe modes
enabled?_

.relative url include
....
include::include.sample.txt[]
....

.relative url partial include
....
include::include.sample.txt[tag=part]
....


== using images

_image links do work, images have to be copied separatly
(e.g. with gradle copy task)._ 

=== relative image 

image::avatar.jpg[]

=== absolute image url
